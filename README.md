# Synchrony-Development

This is the SynChrony Web Application source code files. 
From here, you will be able to run the application on your local device.
Please read more to learn about how to deploy the application.

Prerequisites:
- You are using a computer that runs on operating system Windows 10 
- You are using Google Chrome version 95 as your browser 
Note that this may work on other browsers, but aesthetic implementation may not work as desired due to incompatible browser implementation

How to run the application
To run the application, you first need to install nodeJS.
Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine.
This will also download the npm download manager, which will be used for our application 

Please download this from the following link:
https://nodejs.org/en/download/ 

Then, you need to download the angular Command Line Interface (CLI) 

Open a terminal and key in the following information:
npm install -g @angular/cli 

From the terminal, navigate to where the readme is found.
If you do not know how to do this, simply navigate to your file on the file exporer, then click on the file directory address (the top bar of the file exporer) and copy it into your clipboard.

Open a new terminal and type the following command:
cd <paste>
press enter 

Run the following command to install our documents 
npm install all 

When this is done, run the code 
ng serve --open

When the application has finished compiling, a new browser window will open to show our application.

Do ensure that your default browser is Google Chrome, else simply copy the URL into a Google Chrome Browser and it should open as well.
